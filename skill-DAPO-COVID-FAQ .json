In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.\nWhat is COVID-19?\n\nCOVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of COVID-19?\n\nThe most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.\n\nHow does COVID-19 spread?\n\nPeople can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.\n\nWHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.    \n\nCan the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?\n\nStudies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”\n\nCan CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?\n\nThe main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings "

For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure, because 14 days is the longest incubation period seen for similar coronaviruses. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period."

COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks.\nCOVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes, mouth or nose. \nExposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\nYou can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19. To protect yourself, make sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.  \nYou can recover from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Catching the new coronavirus DOES NOT mean you will have it for life.\nMost of the people who catch COVID-19 can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies. If you catch the disease, make sure you treat your symptoms. If you have cough, fever, and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early – but call your health facility by telephone first. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.\nBeing able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort DOES NOT mean you are free from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or any other lung disease.\nThe most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, tiredness and fever. Some people may develop more severe forms of the disease, such as pneumonia. The best way to confirm if you have  the virus producing COVID-19 disease is with a laboratory test.  You cannot confirm it with this breathing exercise, which can even be dangerous.\nDrinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous\nFrequent or excessive alcohol consumption can increase your risk of health problems. \nCOVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates\nFrom the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.\nAre antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?\nNo, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.\nThe new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.\nHowever, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.\nAre there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?\nTo date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\nHowever, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.\nDoes the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?\nPeople of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. \nWHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene."

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), many diseases and conditions are spread by not washing hands with soap and water.\n\nAs simple as it sounds, a thorough technique with soap and clean, running water lasting at least 20 seconds is the best approach to preventing the further spread of germs. The temperature of the water when washing does not matter.\n\n“When washing hands with soap and water, it’s really the mechanical scrubbing action that’s cleaning your hands. You can use warm or cold water,” Chang said. “You have to be sure you wash or scrub long enough and completely dry your hands\n\n.MYTH: Vitamin C can help fight the virus.\n\nFACT: Vitamin C is an essential vitamin found in many fruits and vegetables that can help boost the immune system. However, research shows that taking vitamin C won’t even fight the common cold for most people.\n\n“Studies show that vitamin C has no significant benefit in preventing or treating the common cold for most patients—and COVID-19 is not the common cold,” said Joyce Samuel, M.D., an associate professor of pediatrics at UTHealth’s McGovern Medical School and a pediatric nephrologist with UT Physicians.\n\nSusan Wootton, M.D., associate professor of pediatrics at McGovern Medical School and an infectious disease pediatrician with UT Physicians, adds that there is no current data to support using extra vitamin C to fight COVID-19.\n\n“In fact, our body can only absorb a certain amount of vitamin C at a time and any excess will be excreted,” Wootton said. “Those who are stocking up on the vitamin are not benefiting from the extra intake.”\n\nMYTH: The virus will die off once temperatures rise.\n\nFACT: It is unknown whether COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, will follow the flu season and disappear during warmer months. Although it can present similar respiratory problems, COVID-19 is different from viruses that cause influenza.\n\n“Because this is a new virus, we aren’t sure,” said epidemiologist Catherine Troisi, Ph.D., an associate professor in Management, Policy and Community Health with UTHealth School of Public Health. “We hope that warmer weather will help, but there is no guarantee. What ultimately helps is that summertime means kids are not in school anymore and they are less likely to pass viruses around.”\n\nMYTH: Drinking water every 15 minutes reduces your risk of contracting the virus.\n\nFACT: Another rumor suggests that drinking water regularly will help flush the virus through the body. Although drinking water can help with dehydration, there’s no evidence of protection against contracting COVID-19.\n\n“Gargling warm water won’t help either,” warned Luis Ostrosky, M.D., professor of internal medicine at McGovern Medical School and an infectious disease specialist with UT Physicians.\n\nStill, water is a great idea for staying hydrated and during recovery from any infection, Wootton added.\n\nMYTH: Masks protect against COVID-19.\n\nFACT: Face masks are only recommended for patients who are sick and the health care workers treating them.\n"

While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating.\n\nWhat can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?\n\nProtection\n\n\n\nProtection measures for everyone\n\nStay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.\n\nYou can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:\n\nRegularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.\nWhy? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.\nWhy? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.\nWhy? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.\nWhy? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.\nWhy? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.\nWhy? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas."

That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient. Current CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation is made on a case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following requirements: The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications. The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough. The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24 hours apart. Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others."

            "The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to limit social interactions as much as possible. Parents should minimize play dates, and if held, parents should keep the groups small. Advise older children to hang out in a small group and to meet up outside rather than inside. It’s easier to keep and maintain space between others in outdoor settings, like parks. If you have small meetups, consider hanging out with another family or friend who is also taking extra measures to put distance between themselves and others (i.e. social distancing). Make sure children practice everyday preventive behaviors , such as cleaning and then disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. Remember, if children meet outside of school in bigger groups, it can put everyone at risk. This includes spring break and other group travel. Parents should help their older children revise spring break plans that included non-essential travel to crowded areas. Information about COVID-19 in children is somewhat limited, but current data suggest children with COVID-19 may show only mild symptoms. However, they can still pass this virus onto others who may be at higher risk, including older adults and people who have serious chronic medical conditions"

            "Stay in touch with your child’s school. Many schools are adapting in-person lessons to online or virtual learning. Review assignments from the school, and help your child establish a reasonable pace for completing the work. You may need to assist your child with turning on devices, reading instructions, and typing answers. Communicate challenges to your school. If you face technology or connectivity issues, or if your child is having a hard time completing assignments, let the school know. Create a schedule and routine for learning at home, but remain flexible. Have consistent bedtimes and get up at the same time, Monday through Friday. Structure the day for learning, free time, healthy meals and snacks, and physical activity. Allow flexibility in the schedule—it’s okay to adapt based on your day. Consider the needs and adjustment required for your child’s age group. The transition to being at home will be different for preschoolers, K-5, middle school students, and high school students. Talk to your child about expectations and how they are adjusting to being at home versus at school. Consider ways your child can stay connected with their friends without spending time in person. Look for ways to make learning fun. Have hands-on activities, like puzzles, painting, drawing, and making things. Independent play can also be used in place of structured learning. Encourage children to build a fort from sheets or practice counting by stacking blocks. Practice handwriting and grammar by writing letters to family members. This is a great way to connect and limit face-to-face contact. Start a journal with your child to document this time and discuss the shared experience. Use audiobooks or see if your local library is hosting virtual or live-streamed reading events."

Originally formed in Ajegunle by a group of about 20 boys with the objective of \"fighting perceived injustice in the city\", some members of the group however hijacked the group into being involved in robbery activities, rape and maiming. A movie titled 1 Million Boyz was released in 2014 based on their thefts and activities. On October 9, 2012, about 130 suspected members of the group were arrested by the Lagos State Police Command during a raid around Apapa and Ajegunle.\n\nDue to the current covid-19 lockdown in the country since March 2020,the group (one million boys) have been moving around different parts of Lagos State causing so much unrest. They start their operations by sending letters to residents of the areas that they would be visiting them at night...\n\nResidents of different communities in Lagos are now in panic mood after the dreaded One Million Boys wrote letters of their intending robbery operations and demanded that residents should keep money for them or be prepared to lose their hands. The warning has really instilled fear in residents, who had known how the dreaded bandits, One Million Boys operated in the past.\n\nIn their letter captioned; Alert! Alert!! Alert!!! the robbers stated, “We the undefeated One Million Boys will visit your area soon. Keep money for us and if you fail to do so, we will cut off your hands during the operations”."
