# COVID-19 CHATBOT BUILT FOR INFORMATION AND CRISS COMMUNICATION AND IBM SPSS ANAYLSIS FOR THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
This is a simple way for building the Covid19 info app. 
Login into https://cloud.ibm.com/login with  your Email address and password 
Create  the service called the Watson assistant. Launch the assistant and enter the service. Once in the Watson assistant, create a dialog skill by importing  my trained dialog skill,with the name #skill-DAPO-COVID-FAQ .json, you can download above. 
The chatbot that I made helps to solve the following PROBLEMS
(1) The chatbot EDUCATES people about the novel covid-19 disease and its causative organism called coronavirus 
(2)The chatbot EDUCATES people on the mode of transmission of the Covid19 disease and the prevention tips
(3)The chatbot gives FIRST HAND information about the disease, 
(4)The chatbot can be used to get get first hand information about the total confirm cases of coronavirus diesesa and the number of deaths due to Covid19 disease in the world and also in any country

Step 6 Click on the preview link url and explore the menu of commnads .My chatbot is UNIQUE because I provided a menu of  commands so that the user of the chatbot will find it easy to search contents embedded in the chatbot ![Image ](https://github.com/dapo4u/COVID19-CRISS-INFORMATION-APP/blob/master/15.png)
The user types the commands one at a time, so that the chatbot can respond.the user can also search for other things through the use of watson discovery,example of the command are WHO FAQ1,Animal contact
PROBLEMS SOLVED BY THE CHATBOT
(1)My chattbot solved the problem of ambiguation and wrong spelling as experienced by users from other chatbots.I solved this problem by providing the user with a menu of commands so that the user will be guided on the correct spellings of words that the chatbot can rescognize and respond to.
(2)My chatbot  gives FIRST HAND information about the covid-19 disease,for example in my country Nigeria,there were fears and debate over whether  it is risky or not to attend the burial of the former chief of staff to the president of Nigeria.I told them that they should check my chatbot and they should the   word funeral and the chatbot responded that its not risky to touch the body of a dead covid-19 person or to attend the funeral of that poerson.
(3)My chatbot also gives the information about the total number of confirmed cases and deaths in the world and in a country ![Image ](https://github.com/dapo4u/COVID19-CRISS-INFORMATION-APP/blob/master/16.png)
(4)My chatbot contains phone numbers of local police officers(these phone numbers can be gotten from the menu of commands) who can be called upon whenever a local armed robbery gang called the ONE MILLION BOYS tries to rob  law-abiding citizens of their valuables during the FG of Nigeria LOCKDOWN ORDER in response to the covid-19 pandemic,this is why my chatbot is a criss communication manager
